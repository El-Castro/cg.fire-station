## Use of AI Tools in this project's development.

During the development of this project, we made use of AI tools to help in our work in several ways.

These included debugging and help in understanding console errors, exploring solutions to specific problems (like how to improve our shaders and our lightning components), identifying more efficient approaches (to improve the helicopter's actions or to reduce framerate issues in our world, for example), and brainstorming ideas.

It is important for us to declare that all AI generated answers were carefully reviewed and analyzed before being implemented and in most cases, the AI's output served only as a starting point or as a "skeleton" for our own code.

We always made an effort to understand the AI's output first, rather than just accepting its responses blindly, that meaning that every decision to include the AI's solution was made with critical thought and with the goal of improving the quality and efficiency of our work.
